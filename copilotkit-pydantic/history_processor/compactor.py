5. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.

IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests without confirming with the user first.
8. If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions. This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing with the conversation and supporting any continuing tasks.
The user will be presented with a preview of your generated summary and can choose to use it to compact their context window or keep chatting in the current conversation.
Users may refer to this tool as 'smol' or 'compact' as well. You should consider these to be equivalent to 'condense' when used in a similar context.
